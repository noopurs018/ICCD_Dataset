Indian Cities Change Detection (ICCD) Dataset is a curated high-resolution remote sensing dataset developed for semi-supervised building change detection. It consists of bi-temporal satellite image pairs (im1 and im2) and corresponding change masks (label) for ten Indian cities: Agra, Ambala, Amritsar, Jammu, Kanpur, Kannur, Kargil, Pune, Roorkee, and Sagar.  It encompasses newly constructed buildings, demolished structures, and redeveloped sites where existing buildings have been replaced by new establishments.
The dataset is organized city-wise, enabling evaluation and generalization across different urban domains. For each city, labeled and unlabeled data have been collected from 2020 to 2024, depending on availability. The labeled set contains im1, im2, and label folders, while the unlabeled set contains only im1 and im2. All images are in RGB format at 1024×1024 resolution.
The ICCD dataset supports applications in:
• Building change detection
• Cross-city domain generalization across diverse geographies
• Semi-supervised learning with city-wise domain shifts
This dataset provides a comprehensive, real-world benchmark to advance research in remote sensing, semi-supervised change detection, and domain adaptation.
